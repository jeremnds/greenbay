# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret


# Google OAuth
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
```

Refer to the `.env.example` file for more information on required environment variables.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

To set up the database schema for Greenbay, you need to execute the SQL commands that will create the necessary tables and relationships. These tables include products, categories, orders, and users.

### Importing the Database Schema

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root of your project.

2. Ensure you have a working Supabase project set up. You will need your Supabase URL and API keys.

3. Run the provided SQL schema file to create the necessary tables in your Supabase database:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-url -U your-username -d your-database-name -f schema.sql
```

Or you can use the SQL editor in the Supabase dashboard to manually execute the SQL commands.

You can find the `schema.sql` file in the root of the project: [schema.sql](./schema.sql)

This file contains the following tables:

- **products**: Contains the product information, including price, category, and availability.
- **categories**: Holds the categories for organizing products.
- **orders**: Manages orders, linking users to purchased items.
- **users**: Stores user account details, including roles and authentication information.

Executing this file will set up your database for use with the Greenbay project.
